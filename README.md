# [DATA REQUIRED]
You are a test subject stuck in a VR environment tasked with testing various new prototype weaponry ... by killing your fellow test subjects. Grab a weapon, take aim, kill everyone else, and survive as the last subject to collect data. Be the first to hit your quota data required to complete the test protocol and win. But remember, there will always be more ...

## About the Gamemode
[DATA REQUIRED] is a top-down arcade arena shooter. All players spawn in a generated maze and will need to find and pick up weapon drops to be able to kill other players. Almost all weapons can kill in a single shot, and can also kill yourself if you're not careful. Be the last survivor to win the round, and win the max amount of rounds to win the game!

The gamemode is inspired by Tank Trouble and was made for the 2017 Gamemode Competition.
